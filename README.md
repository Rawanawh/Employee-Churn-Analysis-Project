# Employee-Churn-Analysis-Project
This project is done to understand and analyze the employee patterns in leaving the company and to develop a model to predict if further employees tend to leave as well. Various Data Science procedures have been utilized such as data preparation, data cleaning, data visualization, implementing machine learning/deep learning algorithms and evaluation analysis.

Employee churn is fundamentally the turnover rate of employees who have decided to leave or have been terminated from the company. In terms of high employee churning, the HR department of any company must spend considerable amount of money, time and effort to find suitable replacements for these previous employees. High turnovers can have negative impacts on the company or orgranization in terms of:

Recruitment Cost
Severance Pay
Loss of productivity
Time taken to train new recruit

## Cluster Analysis Result Using K-Means Clustering

* Cluster 0: We can notice that the satisfaction_level is the lowest, and the mean of the number of the projects, average_montly_hours, time_spend_company are the highest. When we compare the actual labels with the clusters we can say the mean of those who left is very high for cluster 0. <br><br>
* Cluster 1 : We can notice that the satisfaction_level is the highest, average_montly_hours, time_spend_company, and the number of projects are within the average. But this cluster has the lowest mean of employees who left, so they are satisfied with their positions. <br><br>
* Cluster 2 :  We can notice that the satisfaction_level is good enough, they have few projects, and work lower than the average time_spend_company and average_montly_hours. the left mean for this cluster is moderate so they may overlap in this cluster.
